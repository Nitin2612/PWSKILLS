        "\n",
        "**Logistic Regression** is a statistical model used primarily for **binary classification** tasks (though it can be extended to multiclass problems). Instead of predicting a continuous output, logistic regression predicts the **probability** that a given input belongs to a particular class. It uses the **sigmoid (logistic) function** to map any real-valued number into the range [0, 1], which can then be interpreted as a probability. The model is typically optimized using **maximum likelihood estimation**.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Linear Regression**, in contrast, is used for predicting **continuous outcomes**. It models the relationship between one or more independent variables and a continuous dependent variable by fitting a **linear equation**. The goal is to minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values, often using the **least squares method**.\n",

        "### Key Differences\n",

        "  - *Logistic Regression:* Designed for classification problems where the outcome is categorical (e.g., 0/1, yes/no).\n",
        "  - *Linear Regression:* Designed for regression problems where the outcome is a continuous value.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Output:**\n",
        "  - *Logistic Regression:* Outputs a probability (between 0 and 1) which is usually thresholded (e.g., at 0.5) to decide the class label.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Transformation:**\n",
        "  - *Logistic Regression:* Uses the sigmoid function to squash the output of a linear equation into a [0, 1] range.\n",
